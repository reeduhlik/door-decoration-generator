# Door Decoration Generator

I love it when my ability to code comes in handy in non-traditional ways.

As an RA on Georgetown's campus, I have to create door decorations at the start of the year before freshman move in.
This year, I decided to make my theme "Mario Kart Powerups."

So, rather than drag and dropping 70+ textboxes and images into a word document, I decided to automate the process by writing python scripts to:

1. Generate names for each door decoration in a specific font and color.
2. Choose a random powerup for each person.
3. Position the name in the correct spot on the image.
4. Export all of them to a single PDF for easy printing and lamination.

Is this the most exciting project ever? No.
But, it saved me a tremendous amount of time and was fun to build.
